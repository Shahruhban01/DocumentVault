# Document Vault

**Document Vault** is a secure web application that allows users to upload, manage, and download files such as images, PDFs, and text files. The application ensures that only authenticated users can access the files, making it a personal, secure vault for storing documents.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Only authorized users can log in to view, upload, or delete documents.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload documents including images, PDFs, and text files.
- **File Preview**: View images and text files directly in the browser. PDF files can be viewed within an embedded viewer.
- **File Management**: Users can download or delete their uploaded files.
- **Secure Uploads**: Files are uploaded with a secret key to ensure secure uploads.
- **File Deletion**: Users can delete files with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletion.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (MDBootstrap for styling)
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL (via PDO for database interaction)

## How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites

- PHP installed on your server (or local machine)
- MySQL database set up
- A web server such as Apache or Nginx

### 2. Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   https://github.com/Shahruhban01/DocumentVault.git
   ```

2. **Configure Database**:
   - Create a MySQL database.
   - Import the SQL file to create the necessary `files` table.

   Example SQL for the `files` table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE `files` (
       `id` INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       `title` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       `file_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       `created_at` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

3. **Update Database Configuration**:
   - Edit the `config/db.php` file with your database credentials:
   ```php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $db = 'database_name';
   $user = 'database_user';
   $pass = 'database_password';
   ```

4. **Set Up File Upload Directory**:
   - Create a `Files` directory in the root of the project to store uploaded files:
   ```
   mkdir Files
   chmod 755 Files
   ```

### 3. Usage

1. **Log In**:
   - The application requires authentication using static credentials.
   - Default credentials:
     ```
     Username: admin
     Password: password123
     ```

2. **Upload Files**:
   - Once logged in, you can upload files (images, PDFs, text files) by providing a title and selecting the file to upload.
   - Files are uploaded with a unique identifier and stored securely in the `Files` directory.

3. **View Files**:
   - Uploaded files can be previewed directly in the dashboard. Supported formats include images, PDFs, and plain text files.

4. **Download/Delete Files**:
   - Users can download or delete files from the dashboard. Deleting files includes a confirmation prompt for safety.

### 4. Security

- The site includes basic protection through user authentication.
- Files are uploaded with a secret key to ensure secure access.

### 5. Future Improvements

- Stronger encryption for uploaded files.
- Role-based access control for more granular user permissions.
- Improved file type validation for enhanced security.
